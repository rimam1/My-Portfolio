                <h2>House Price Prediction</h2>
                <p>
                  I have developed an ML model which takes 4 parameters
                  location, sqft, num of bathroom and bhk to predict the price
                  of house in Bengaluru with accuracy of over 80% using Linear
                  Regression. I Used Data Analysis & Data Cleaning techniques,
                  Feature Engineering, One Hot Encoding, Model training and
                  testing.

                <h2>Home Automation</h2>
                <p>
                  In this project I have automated the Bulb and Fan of my hostel
                  room. I used Arduino Uno, Bluetooth Module, Relay Module to
                  switch on and switch off my fan and bulb by just sending
                  Bluetooth signal from our mobile phone. Challenges which I
                  faced during this project was it was so risky to deal with the
                  AC Current and do the connections with the board.

                <h2>Line Follower Bot</h2>
                <p>
                  Built a low cost hardware product (â‚¹500-800) which follows
                  black lines and can detect obstacles which come infront of
                  this bot. Designed the circuit by using IR Sensors, Ultrasonic
                  Sensors and wrote Arduino code to get the real time reading of
                  all the sensors in synchronized manner
